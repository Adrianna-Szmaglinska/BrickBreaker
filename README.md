## Brick Breaker Claasic Game (in Java)

A project to recreate a famous brick breaker game using only Java.

The purpose of this project is to learn 2D development, and is part of a wider push to learn how 2D gaming works.

Very helpful to use Java in such a creative manner.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies such as images

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
